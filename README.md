## Course Description 
– Course aim to enhance the basic skills related to signal and systems

## Course Objectives 
- Understanding the fundamental characteristics of signals and systems.  
- Understanding signals and systems in terms of both the time and transform domains, taking advantage of the complementary insights and tools that these different perspectives provide.
- Development of the mathematical skills to solve problems involving convolution, filtering, modulation and sampling.

## Course Outcomes

- CO1	Classify the signals and systems on the basis of their characteristics.
- CO2	Make use of the concept of sampling theorm on CT and DT signals
- CO3	Examine the concepts of Fourier Series and Fourier Transform in signal and system analysis.
- CO4	Importance of LTI Systems in predicting the output using impulse response. 
- CO5	Construct the Continuous and Discrete Time systems using various transfroms.
