## The Program educational objectives of the undergraduate engineering program offered by the department of Mechatronics Engineering is that the graduates are expected:

- PEO1 To become a social leader with an entrepreneurial mindset and a strong commitment to ethical values for the development of the nation through their ability to solve diverse and complex mechanical and electronics engineering problems across a broad range of application areas.

- PEO2 To be able to adapt to the disruptive technologies with an ability to solve larger societal problems using logical and flexible approach in decision making.

- PEO3 To pursue a professional career in the public or private sector, focusing on higher education, research and product development activities.

## Program Outcomes (POs) 
> are attributes of the graduates of the program that are indicative of the graduates’ ability and competence to work as an engineering professional upon graduation. 

> Program Outcomes are statements that describe what students are expected to know or be able to do by the time of graduation. They must relate to knowledge and skills that the students acquire from the program. The achievement of all outcomes indicates that the student is well prepared to achieve the program educational objectives down the road. The following 12 POs have been chosen by the Mechatronics Engineering Department of Chandigarh University. The Mechatronics Engineering curriculum at CU has been designed to fully meet all the 12 Program Outcomes:

- PO1. Engineering Knowledge: Apply knowledge of mathematics, science and engineering fundamentals and Production and Industrial Engineering specialization to the solution of complex Production and Industrial Engineering problems.
- PO2. Problem Analysis: Identify, formulate, research literature and analyze complex Production and Industrial Engineering problems reaching substantiated conclusions using first principles of mathematics, natural sciences and engineering sciences.
- PO3. Design/ Development of Solutions: Design solutions for complex Engineering problems and design system components or processes that meet specified needs with appropriate consideration for public health and safety, cultural, societal and environmental considerations.
- PO4. Conduct investigations of complex Engineering problems: Use research-based knowledge and research methods including analysis, interpretation of data and synthesis of information to provide valid conclusions.
- PO5. Modern Tool Usage: Create, select, and apply appropriate techniques, resources, and modern engineering and IT tools including prediction and modelling to complex engineering activities with an understanding of the limitations.
- PO6. The Engineer and Society: Apply contextual knowledge to assess societal, health, safety, legal and cultural issues and the consequent responsibilities relevant to professional engineering practice.
- PO7. Environment and Sustainability: Understand the impact of the professional engineering solutions in societal and environmental contexts, and demonstrate the knowledge of, and need for sustainable development.
- PO8. Ethics: Apply ethical principles and commit to professional ethics and responsibilities and norms of engineering practice.
- PO9. Individual and Team Work: Function effectively as an individual, and as a member or leader in diverse teams and in multi-disciplinary settings.
- PO10. Communication: Communicate effectively on complex Engineering activities with the engineering community and with society at large, such as being able to comprehend and write effective reports and design documentation, make effective presentations and give and receive clear instructions.
- PO11. Project Management and Finance: Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of Engineering and management principles and apply these to one’s own work, as a member and leader in a team, to manage projects and in multidisciplinary environments.
- PO12. Life Long learning: Recognize the need for, and have the preparation and ability to engage in independent and life-long learning in the broadest context of technological change.
